# JavaScript Bug: Unexpected Result with Null Values

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving the incorrect handling of `null` values in a function.  The function `foo` is intended to add two numbers, but it returns 0 when either input is `null`, leading to unexpected behavior.

The solution demonstrates improved error handling and more robust null value management, enhancing the reliability and predictability of the function.
